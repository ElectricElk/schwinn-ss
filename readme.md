# '82 Schwinn Super Sport Light Kit Installation Project

This repo is meant to serve as a collection of notes to self, and tips for 
anyone else who might want to install a light kit on a bicycle. Note, this 
is only a light kit, not a full electric bike conversion- the drive will 
still be acoustic. Also note, this is _only_ for the light kit, there are 
many other mods one should make- such as upgraded brake pads, fenders, etc.

## Provenance

I work a summer camp for foster kids every year for my summer vacation. The 
guy who started all of the camps in the Chicago region is named Pastor J. 
This bike (one of the last Schwinns made in Chicago) was his primary whip 
all through seminary school. Then he graduated, got a big-boy job, and it 
hung in his garage for ~30 years. He gave it to my buddy, whose garage it 
hung in for another ~5 years. And finally, I came into it. Having been 
driving Electric Elks for the last two years, I've gotten spoiled on 
rear-view cameras, tire pressure monitoring systems, and full signal arrays, so 
I am setting out to reintroduce those on an acoustic bike. I am keeping my 
notes here to pay it forward/help the next person. 

Feel free to either DM me (is that a thing on github?) or open an issue if 
you have questions/tips/etc.
